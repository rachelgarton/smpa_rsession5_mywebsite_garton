    "text": "All Things Go Creator Summit Draws Attention to an Evolving Industry\nWASHINGTON — Developers of the annual All Things Go Music Festival highlighted the importance of women in media in light of a changing industry on Oct. 15 during the festival’s Creator Summit at the Eaton Hotel in Washington.\nThrough discussion tables and a series of speakers divided by profession, the creator summit used keynote speakers to focus upon how women fit into the music industry and offered encouragement for attendees looking to get into media.\n“One of the reasons we love this festival — All Things Go — is because it’s very female driven. I never realized that it’s just a big support for female artists and I think it’s important to see women headliners in big festivals,” said Wendi “Madison” Rickman, a SiriusXM host and creator summit leader.\nThe All Things Go Festival, also known as the All Things Go Fall Classic, was co-founded in 2011 by Adrian Maseda, Will Suter, Zack Friendly and Stephen Vallimarescu. The festival features mainly alternative and indie-based female artists, but is also known for its support of LGBTQ+ artists.\nThe concert series has grown so much in popularity that developers have been forced to quadruple the venue capacity. Just this year, creators announced that the festival would be making the move from Union Market — where the festival was founded — to Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Md., which has a capacity of over 19,000 people.\nWhile prominent artists such as MUNA, Melanie Martinez and Billie Eilish have all headlined the festival in recent years, the support towards female artists goes on behind the scenes as well.\n“A lot of my spare time is, you know, trying to build a network of superstars in this industry of not only women but men as well … everybody needs a helping hand to kind of guide them and say that you can make it,” said President and Managing Partner Jeanine McLean of MBK Entertainment.\nMcLean, who played a prominent role in rolling out this year’s festival, has also represented artists such as H.E.R. and Alicia Keys. In her year off from helping produce the All Things Go Festival, McLean aided in creating an online series with H.E.R. titled “Girls With Guitars,” which spotlights female guitar players to give them a platform to talk about their love of music.\nVice President of A&R Admin Nikisha Bailey said that “Girls With Guitars” is one example of how drastically the industry has changed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“We have artists that record a song in their hotel and they want it up the next day. So just even in terms of how you pivot to a company with those artists and how quick they want to release music, like to have people finding sounds from TikTok … I’m not even sure where it’s going to go. Like, where do you go after this?” Bailey said.\nTikTok, a social media app that allows creators to post videos — both for fun and promotional purposes — has revolutionized the music industry. A study by MRC data demonstrated how trending songs on the app commonly end up on the Billboard and Spotify charts, as users have the tendency to seek out trending “sounds” on music-streaming sites.\n“Social media is interfering with our actual career. You know it’s, like, almost as important as making images and so is making a TikTok, and I am horrible. I was joking the other day because I was trying to make a 15 second TikTok within five hours,” said Chelsea Lee of the band SHAED.\nSHAED, who have broken genre barriers with their multi-platinum song “Trampoline,” has recently made the transition into a mostly virtual career following the announcement of Lee’s pregnancy. Although the trio will eventually return to in-person events, they currently plan on staying virtual for the foreseeable future.\n“I mean, we became like expert couch concert consumers … and silver lining wise, we finally got a chance to kind of rest and write an album. Nothing beats the in-person stuff, but it was a (nice) alternative for us,” said Lee.\nSHAED is not the only artist to make a transition into more experimental ways of promoting their music. Within the past year, multiple artists have made the switch into virtual concert platforms such as Roblox, Instagram Live or Veeps. Although non-traditional, the appearances appear to be successful, with Lil Nas X’s Roblox concert gaining 33 million views, and band Twenty One Pilots kicking off their first tour in two years with a virtual Roblox concert experience.\n“You do have to be in so many places at once. As a musician, it’s been wild to see the innovation that’s happened, even just during this period of time of COVID. People, you know, we’re kind of forced to really revolutionize the way that they were thinking about virtual and the gaming industry,” said key-speaker Jennifer Leiweke.\nWhile the music industry has always been fast paced, social media is changing the game once more, with women spear-heading the competition."

    "text": "Aside from being a Journalism and Mass Communications Major, I am also an English major, which has taught me how to better format my papers. Below is a paper that I believe best combines the best of the two majors for a “Media Organizations and Audiences” class.\nRachel Garton\nProfessor Phalen\nSMPA 3333\nApril 26th, 2022\nMisogyny in Marvel\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe is presently recognized as a media franchise that dominates the global box office, taking four of the top ten highest-grossing movie spots of all time. Despite its acclaim now, the string of superhero movies weren’t always popular. Prior to the 2008 Marvel Studios’ release of Iron Man, the concept of a movie starring the “genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist” known as Tony Stark had been deliberated over for more than twenty years (Wetzel 4). Aside from its lack of success getting on the big screen –even with the rights being passed to and from Universal Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox– the film was not estimated to be a box office hit. Jon Favreau was fairly unknown at the time as a director, but had a deep interest in the character; Robert Downey Jr., who would play Iron Man, had a “questionable” past by Hollywood’s standards; and producers had trouble getting the film financed (Wetzel 82). The film, however, was an unexpected hit with a gross of more than $585 million worldwide. When Disney CEO Bob Iger bought the rights to Marvel Entertainment for four billion in cash and stock in 2009, plans were immediately put in place to make a sequel to Iron Man, and hopefully match its predecessors’ success. Executives were also contemplating how to connect superheroes into a major blockbuster movie, and effectively drawing in as large of an audience as possible. Thus, casting calls were made to form the Avengers, including one for Natasha Romanoff, better known by the alias Black Widow, who would be the first official Marvel Studios female superhero. However, while the movie was well-received with a 72% score on Rotten Tomatoes and $624 million in box office earnings, the manner in which Natasha was presented was met with backlash (Wetzel 102). Although things have drastically changed for Marvel Studios in the 12 years since Iron Man 2’s release, the troubles the studio had with its male characters prior to Iron Man’s release seems to have foreshadowed similar troubles in initiating storylines for its female characters. Thus, while examples of female superheroes are greatly improving, the initial efforts made to incorporate women in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) were undermined by examples of misogyny in production, distristribution, and audience consumption. Marvel Studio’s growth, and its lacking portrayal of women, will be shown through examples of female characters divided by each of the studios’ “phases,” where each phase indicates an end to a story.\nPHASE 1 : IRON MAN (2008) - THE AVENGERS (2012) Phase 1 of the MCU began with Iron Man (Favreau 2008), which featured little female representation. In one of the first scenes of the movie, the audience is introduced to Christine Everheart: a journalist who is only worthy to speak to Tony Stark after she is deemed “attractive” enough. The two engage in competitive back-and-forth conversation, with a few sexually-charged comments on Stark’s behalf, until the scene cuts to Everheart waking up in his bed, but with Tony nowhere to be seen. Tony’s assistant, Pepper Potts, is quick to evict Christine, and even alludes to her as being part of the “trash” she has to take out. Both Christine and Pepper remain mostly inconsequential to the plot of the movie, with feminist critics pointing out how Potts acts as a “glorified accessory, doing [Stark’s] bidding, cleaning up after him, and taking care of him” (Meluso 2020). After Disney took more of an active role with the multi-billion purchase of Marvel following the success of Iron Man, president of Marvel Studios Kevin Fiege promised encouraging representation of beloved comic characters (Wetzel 103). With Victoria Alonso helping produce the MCU alongside Fiege, things looked promising. Yet Alonso herself admits how little women are accepted into the superhero industry in a quote that reads “When I walk into a room, I do a headcount of males and females. When I leave, I say it. Every room, every time. I get no pride, no power by being by myself. I’m happy to hold the banner, but I don’t want to be there alone” (Hollywood Reporter 2018). The number of men to women in the “super hero industry” became increasingly evident with the release of Iron Man 2 (Favreau 2010), where Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff was unveiled. After figuring out that the arc reactor that keeps him alive is also killing him, Tony Stark promotes Pepper Potts to CEO, and is in search of a new assistant. In being interviewed for the role of his assistant while undercover for S.H.I.E.L.D., Romanoff’s introductory scene coincides with a shot of her in lingerie. Following her exit, Stark even tells his friend that he “wants one,” referring to Natasha as an object instead of a person. Iron Man 2 has also been heavily criticized for the skin-tight catsuit Romanoff wears in combat, where it is not only impractical for battle but is also unzipped to accentuate her cleavage (Meluso 2020). This in line with Meluso’s theory on the male gaze in the MCU, in which women’s appearances are altered for strong visual and erotic impact, while subsequently doing little to advance the plot. Also in line with this narrative are the movies Thor (Branagh 2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (Johnston 2011), and The Avengers (Whedon 2012). In each of these examples, there is a female character that acts as some form of love interest to the male-centered main character (Thor– Jane Foster, Captain America– Peggy Carter, The Avengers– Natasha Romanoff). In Thor, it is Jane’s intelligence and kindness that inspires Thor to change his ways; in Captain America, it is Peggy that serves as a motivator for Steve Rogers; Natasha is the glue that holds the team together in The Avengers, encouraging them to work together instead of fight one another. As Meluso points out, these women are not valued as themselves, but are “valuable instead for what they cause the heroes to feel and do”: it is the man that moves the plot forward, and the women are simply the catalysts for their actions (Meluso 2020).\nPHASE 2: IRON MAN 3 (2013) - ANT-MAN (2015)\nThese themes continue into Phase 2, where despite the introduction of more characters, the female role stays mostly the same. In the first film of Phase 2, Pepper Potts briefly gains powers through a procedure known as “extremis” (genetic manipulation that allows the body to heal and regenerate from physical and mental damages), but Tony Stark quickly vows to find a way to “cure” her. A similar plot happens in Thor: The Dark World (Taylor 2013), where Thor’s love interest, Jane Foster, is imbued with the aether (an infinity stone that affects reality). Although the aether is dangerous in the body of a mortal such as Jane, she becomes minimized to the role of damsel in distress, where Thor and his brother, Loki, must do the work in ‘saving’ her. While the powers the women gain are considered dangerous, it is no less dangerous than how the majority of male heroes come into their superpowers. In accordance with Meluso, it appears to be more a matter of protecting the woman from that power and the connotations it brings (Meluso 2020). With Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Russo 2014), Natasha Romanoff makes her third MCU appearance. Even with the opportunity to incorporate Natasha’s background in what made her shift from Russian assassin to American spy and hero, she is instead used more as a potential love interest to Steve Rogers. Meluso and Ameter even argue that Romanoff is used as a reminder of “heterosexual love” for Captain America, in a movie that is dominated by his relationship to his childhood best friend, Bucky Barnes (Meluso 2020, Ameter 2019). Moreover, in the face of the backlash Black Widow’s combat suit received from fans in previous movies, her suit stays mostly the same, with miniscule changes. The questionable wardrobe of female characters remains to be a point of contention in both Guardians of the Galaxy (Gunn 2014) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (Whedon 2015). Stylistically, Gamora, the sole female hero of the Guardians, is dressed in skin-tight clothing and a corset for the majority of the film. Furthermore, despite the emphasis of the role of family in the movie, she nonetheless becomes a love interest to Peter Quill’s Starlord. The trend continues into Avengers: Age of Ultron, where Wanda Maximoff’s Scarlet Witch is introduced. Although her brother wears a running suit to reflect his superspeed and the Avengers all have respective armor (minus, of course, Black Widow), Maximoff is dressed only in a low-cut dress, ripped stockings, and a red leather jacket. As Ameter argues, this is a common theme found in the uniforms of the MCU female heroes (Ameter 2019). While it can be argued that the blame for this portrayal can be solely placed on those working on set or in studio, the problem extends to distribution and marketing as well. Many critics have pointed out how, in posters, male heroes will be facing the camera in a “heroic” pose, where female heroes are facing away from the camera, with the shot angled up their back to emphasize their buttocks. For love interests such as Jane Foster or Pepper Potts, they appear fearful yet secure in the arms of the male hero. Additionally, in the marketing for Avengers, it was Marvel’s Creative Committee that blocked the production of Black Widow-themed merchandise, because some thought that superhero products promoting a “girl” wouldn’t sell (Wetzel 109-110).\nPHASE 3: CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (2016) - SPIDER-MAN : FAR FROM HOME (2019)\nThe controversial treatment of Black Widow and other female characters carried into Phase 3 of the MCU, despite the franchise’s growing popularity. With Avengers: Age of Ultron making over $1 billion in the box office and gaining more critical acclaim, executives had to start making decisions on how to change the perception of its female superheroes. At first, hardly any change was made with the release of Captain America: Civil War (Russo 2016). Wanda Maximoff is referred to as a “kid” in the movie (although her age is hotly debated to be somewhere between 24-27) and is locked in the Avengers Compound until Hawkeye comes to break her out. Natasha Romanoff, on the other hand, is once again demoted to being the equivalent of Switzerland in the feud between Captain America and Iron Man over government sanctions on superheros known as the Sokovia Accords. Although Romanoff takes the side of Iron Man in the film, she consistently questions Tony’s decisions and ultimately helps Captain America make a grand escape from battle, effectively making her a government fugitive by the movie’s conclusion. Women play a comparatively small role in both Doctor Strange (Derrickson 2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (Gunn 2017), and Spider-Man: Homecoming (Watts 2017). In Doctor Strange, a character known as “The Ancient One” acts as a mentor to Dr Stephen Strange. She dies three-fourths of the way through the movie, in a move that is meant to pass the mantle of “Sorcerer Supreme” to the male hero. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, there is growth in Gamora’s storyline outside of her relationship to Starlord, but she is ultimately defined by her relationship to the male hero. Meluso’s point about women being a catalyst for men’s actions also plays heavily into this film, where –once Starlord discovers that his father, a god-like being named Ego, killed his mother– he spurs himself into action (Meluso 2020). In Spider-Man: Homecoming, the primary female character, Liz Allan, is Peter Parker’s love interest, as well as daughter to the antagonist of the film. Thor: Ragnarok (Waititi 2017), however, shows particular growth in its depiction of women. It is the first film of the MCU where the main antagonist is a woman. Furthermore, one of the characters Thor befriends is Valkyrie: a female warrior of the Norse Asgard, whose combat outfit includes full body armor, with no corset in sight. This hopeful trend continues into Black Panther (Coogler 2018). Not only is it the first MCU movie where the central protagonist is Black, but it extends deeper into intersectionality with its depiction of a powerful group of female warriors known as the Dora Milaje and the acknowledgement that Shuri –little sister to Black Panther’s T’challa– is the smartest character in the MCU. However, while important strides have been made in these examples, it is also important to note that these women are not central figures in each respective film and do not yet have “their own origin or solo breakout films” (Taylor 2021). In spite of the strides Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther made, Avengers: Infinity War (Russo 2018) appears to take a step back in its utilization of the female heroes. Guardians of the Galaxy’s Gamora is killed halfway through the movie; Captain Marvel doesn’t show up until after the battle has been lost; Scarlet Witch, despite having powers derivative of an infinity stone, is watching over her love interest, Vision, to which a comment is jokingly made “why was she up there all this time?” when she finally joins the battle. Meluso also points out that Vision’s love and concern for Wanda is what causes decisions to be made in the film, and not Wanda herself (Meluso 2020). Quickly following Avengers: Infinity War’s release, however, are two movies that made the most substantial strides for Marvel to date. First was the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp (Reed 2018), which was the first movie in which a superheroine made her way into half of a feature film title (Fimibanti 2020). While still a love interest to Scott Lang’s Ant-Man, Hope Pym’s Wasp exists outside of her relationship to Scott and has considerable character growth centered around her family instead of the male hero. Second was Captain Marvel (Boden 2019), the first MCU film centered around a female hero, but also Marvel’s most controversial movie. Although Captain Marvel eclipsed more than $1 billion in the box office, the movie has faced major backlash from male fans, who down-voted the film on Rotten Tomatoes to the point where the website had to change its rules in allowing users to post a review to a movie before its been released (Killian 2019). Aside from the negative reviews, Captain Marvel was also hailed by film critics to be “the worst thing to happen to the MCU” (Killian 2019). Interestingly, on the other hand, is how women composed under 19% of the data pool for reviewers on Captain Marvel, which Fimibinati argues is evidence that women aren’t even “the prominent voices surrounding the films that showcase them” in It Wasn’t Made for Him (Fimibinati 2020). Similarly, at the time of Captain Marvel’s release, only 1% of films employed 10 or more women, and audiences were twice as likely to see male characters than female characters, which is demonstrative of a major gender disparity in the media industry (Fimibinati 2020). Critics have also pointed out that Marvel only released Captain Marvel after Warner Bros./DC Comics released Wonder Woman, and were sure of the success of a female-centered superhero movie. Meluso argues that Marvel had access to the rights to Black Widow a full ten years prior to the release of Wonder Woman, but didn’t utilize her character fully until a competitor’s success (Meluso 2020). In the same vein, critics have also pointed out the glaring similarities between Natasha Romanoff’s Black Widow and Carol Danver’s Captain Marvel: they are both “stoic fighters who don’t take anything from anybody,” so when compared to the vast difference in personality given to male heroes, one might wonder why the two central female characters share so many personality traits (Ameter 2019). Even so, Captain Marvel should be awarded for its much-needed strides for female representation in the MCU. From Danver’s suit mirroring the costumes of male heroes to her refusal to accept misogyny, Captain Marvel’s female directors seemed to have learned from the mistakes of their male predecessors. In comparison to Avengers: Endgame (Russo 2019), where Black Widow sacrifices herself to gain an infinity stone that will restore life to the universe, it is certainly a step in the right direction.\nPHASE 4: Black Widow (2021) – Now\nAvengers: Endgame nevertheless opened the door for many future projects starring female-centered superhero roles. The first release of Phase 4 was Wandavision (Shakman 2021), a limited Disney+ series centered around Scarlet Witch. Unlike the stoic composure of her predecessors, Wandavision tackles the concept of female emotions and grief making a character stronger rather than weaker. In Benjamin Jones’ Evolving Portrayal of Female Emotions in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he argues that previous Marvel projects suppressed female emotion and characters, indirectly implying that they have a harder time controlling their feelings than men (Jones 2022). He references that in films featuring Black Widow and Captain Marvel, inherently feminine emotions are used to deceive or defeat a male character, when they actually lack the emotions that the male characters think they are experiencing (e.g., crying). Thus, in a show where Wanda’s emotions are seen as a “source of strength rather than a weakness to be exploited,” it indicates a shift in narrative for female characters, where they are “no longer relegated to the sidelines” (Jones 2022). This shift carries through to the first theatrical release of Phase 4, Black Widow (Shortland 2021). Considered a much-needed installment into the MCU, the film explores the backstory to a character inducted into the franchise over 10 years prior, but also one that has already died, as the film takes place directly following the events of Captain America: Civil War. While some critics have argued that this character development is tempered “by the knowledge that (this) history is all we can ever know,” others have applauded it in depicting the strength and resilience of the female character, as well as expanding Natasha’s emotional palette (Taylor 2021). Furthermore, it is the first MCU film to break the stereotype of a female hero being seen as “shocking” for displaying equal levels of power as male characters. In Gender Portrayal in the MCU, Jess Ameter argues that women’s powers are seen as abnormal to other characters, as it’s unbelievable that a “woman could be strong and powerful enough to rival a man” (Ameter 2019). With Black Widow, Natasha’s enemies take her at face value and as an equal component, demonstrating the exponential growth Marvel has had.\nCONCLUSION In conclusion, Marvel has demonstrated considerable growth, but they may still have a long way to go in being truly intersectional. As of now, only 15 of the 27 films pass the Bechdel Test, and most only scrape by. The Bechdel test merely measures if women are in a movie off of three components: (1) two female characters are named, (2) they have to talk, and (3) their conversation must have nothing to do with a man. However, so far all of the projects from Phase 4 have passed the test with flying covers. Marvel Studios also appears to be expanding into intersectionality, by incorporating more women of color, religion, sexuality, and age, with upcoming projects such as The Marvels, She-Hulk, Ironheart, and Ms Marvel. To continue to make the characters equal beyond just the number of female versus male characters, Ameter argues that it also must be about how the characters interact with others, how similar they are to characters of the same gender, and how they are depicted visually (Ameter 2019). Keeping these characterizations in mind in contrast with current and future projects, it appears that Marvel Studios is changing rapidly to best fit their growing audience.\nWorks Cited Ameter, Jess. “Gender Portrayal in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.” URJ-UCCS, vol. 12, no. 2, 2019, pp. 53-59.

The game is just as good as it always has been, but with improved graphics being the only real selling point, the package is not enough for a second buy.\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Visual improvements and three included DLCs don’t justify buying this game again, but if you haven’t played it on PS3 yet, you’re in for long hours of valuable entertainment.

If you have completed it already you can skip this version, but if you’ve missed out the adventure before you’re in a for a big treat.\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Last of Us is a great action game that you should play if you haven't already. And if you have played it before, the improvements here aren't so dramatic as to make the game feel like a new experience, but it is definitely one worth revisiting. In the world of The Last of Us, as in our own world, love might destroy you, but it's also one of the only things worth fighting for.\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    One of the games on the PlayStation is now one of the best games on the PlayStation 4.\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With far too many action segments and repetitive puzzles, this survival action game gets bogged down by filler. Thankfully the strong last act and great chemistry between leads makes this a must-play, warts and all.\n9  A post-apocalyptic road trip that offers a fantastic, riveting experience, where destruction and beauty, and hope and despair, get entwined in a way that’s nothing short of genius, The Last of Us is so good that its somewhat repetitive, and occasionally dull gameplay isn’t enough to rob it of its rightful place amongst the video game greats. Therefore, if looking for an unforgettable action-adventure, with strong cinematic sensibilities, and a heavy emphasis in adult, character-driven storytelling, look no further than Naughty Dog’s classic, especially now that the remastered version has made the original even more stunning.\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         PlayStation 4 makes The Last of Us look better than ever.

The remastered graphics, especially the improved ambiance and lighting, are a great asset to this game and make it a must-have for every PlayStation 4 owner, especially if you haven't played it yet.\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Last of Us for the PS4 is a perfect game for all people who haven't had the opportunity to get acquainted with it before. It's probably the best game available for this piece of hardware - great story, engaging gameplay and impressive technology. But if you know The Last of Us, you have nothing new to look for, except shiny graphics. And that's not really THAT important, is it?\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This is one of the best console ports in recent history, as it manages to fully capture the spirit of the original while improving upon it in nearly every way.\n17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Simply put, The Last of Us: Remastered is just better than the PS3 version.\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         With its improved detail, better draw distance, and slick 60fps presentation, The Last of Us Remastered is a beautiful update to a beautiful game. It is, however, a re-release of a game that isn't very old to begin with, and that bears taking into account.\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      After 13 months The Last of Us is still impressive. This Remastered edition is the perfect deal for those who have never played Naughty Dog's game, but it doesn't offer anything more to PS3 fans.\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This edition is a must-have only for those who have never had the opportunity to play the game on PS3 and own a PS4. All others can rekindle their old console. Despite this, The Last of Us Remastered is an excellent version of a masterpiece.\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There's not really enough distance between the PS3 version of The Last of Us and this new Remaster to make it worth double-dipping, unless you're simply that fixated on counting lines of resolution. If you missed out the first time around, though, you really shouldn't let it slip past again.\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Still a stunning achievement in both storytelling and third person adventure, and although this is the definitive version the differences are still minor.\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            A touch less impactful now, but one of last year's highlights is still of 2014's best games.

It runs more smoothly, is prettier and has more content. The technical improvements and the Photo Mode make sure that The Last of Us comes into its own even more, while Left Behind on PlayStation 3 already proved that downloadable content can be of value. The small imperfections are still here and it’s unfortunate that the PlayStation 4 isn’t pushed to the limit. Despite all this, Remastered is the best version of an already incredible game.\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For those who couldn’t wait to play the best PlayStation 3 game on Sony’s newest console, we’ve got some good news: The Last of Us Remastered is beautifully crafted and polished. Remastered is a complete package with touched up graphics, while the game’s core remains as brilliant as ever.\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                       While The Last of Us was one of the PS3’s most impressive, engrossing releases, The Last of Us: Remastered feels like the version of Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic story of survival that the developer always intended us to play. Its story and characters are just as strong as they were before, but they’re now reinforced by far more amazing visuals, consistent framerate, and a nice selection of new bonus features and DLC inclusions.\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Last of Us is truly the game of a generation, and the Remastered edition brings the harrowing adventure to a whole new generation with expert style.\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Naughty Dog gives PlayStation gamers a second, definitive chance to experience one of the greatest video game stories. The Last of Us Remastered's additional content, visual enhancements, and improved performance leave very little standing in the way of a perfect encore.\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Do you need to get The Last of Us Remastered? Yes, if you didn't get the opportunity to play this PS3 masterpiece. The game enjoys the power of the PS4 without any trouble in very high resolution. The 60fps argument hits its target too, just like the price tag. But if you've already been there, no need to open your wallet, as this Remastered version doesn't bring anything new enough to put 50 euros on it.\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A must have for those who couldn't play it on PS3. Intense, violent and emotional, Joel and Ellie's tale is as stunning as a year ago. Visual improvements and extra content are the only incentives those who played the original will find, and the reason they will have to think it's worth buying PS4's version.\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If you didn't play it on PS3, this is definitely one the best second chances of your life.

Obviously, if you have the chance of doing it with an improved version, with better visuals, extras and so on, the choice seems clear.\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Last of Us Remastered is a better-looking, better performing version of an already incredible game. As such, those who haven't played the original version should buy immediately, and those that have probably should as well.\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The remastered edition of The Last of Us is simply perfect.\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          What should really sweeten the deal for PS4 owners is the Remastered version of The Last of Us also includes the follow-up downloadable content, such as Ellie’s prequel chapter titled Left Behind.

And it is a fabulous story, riffing on Cormac McCarthy and other bleak post-apocalyptic fiction but keeping its own identity through its characters.\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Not only is The Last of Us technically brilliant, it has little things that just drag you further into the world. They are by no means important to the progression of the story of the game but the make the character seem more human and less one dimensional.\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Last Of Us Remastered absolutely deserves a place in your PlayStation 4 collection, despite whether you’ve played it before or not. The improvements this remaster brings only helps to show you how much of an incredible, beautiful, emotional and downright amazing game this is.\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Even if the Remastered version only really adds improves textures and better framerate, The Last of Us remains one of the greatest games in recent years. It’s a must-have for any PS4 owners who didn’t play the original, and well-worth replaying for those who did.\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  If you have yet to play The Last of Us, and you own a PlayStation 4, I can fully whole heartily say go buy this game, because you’re in for a memorable time. For fans, this is one you might want to pick up if you want to play the game at its best.\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Last of Us Remastered Edition enhances an already perfect game on the PlayStation 3 to something even more powerful on the PS4.\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Of course, the onboard add-on packs and smattering of superfluous extras ensure that this is the definitive edition of an already outstanding affair – but, unsurprisingly, it’s the touching tale at the heart of the package that once again sets it apart from its peers.\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Saying The Last Of Us: Remastered is an absolute triumph seems redundant. I said it when the original released last year, after all. And yeah, it's basically the same game with a glossier coating and a few additions. But consider: What have we seen in the last 15 months or so that even comes close? Seriously?\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             While I’d rather not see a sequel, you should know that this Remastered version basically puts a T-ball stand in Sony’s living room where they’ve now started selling bats. Depending on the level of broken the company's biggest Bravia display could become given that scenario, I'd say the brand is worth a lot of money at the moment.\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Despite some decent titles on Sony’s new machine, you can’t deny the quality of Naughty Dog’s masterpiece. Even the staunchest of advocates that want original experiences on their new console will struggle to find much wrong with The Last of Us.\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Already a masterpiece, an upgraded Last of Us was going to be a win, but with the also brilliant Left Behind included as well as the resurgence of the multiplayer and the bonus featurettes, the remastered version is the best thing out right now.\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     While it may not seem like much, 1080p resolution and 60 fps are very welcome improvements for a nearly perfect game. Naughty Dog managed to do a flawless technical adaptation for the PlayStation 4. We would have loved a bit more extra content, but we can't complain, as the game already is one of the best ever created for a Sony platform.\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The heart-rending story isn`t romanticizing nor does it drift into the pathos other, less subtle games so often lean towards. That's the line where good craftsmanship becomes art, and an excellent game.\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In the end I came to the same conclusion now that I did back then: I had fun with the game itself, but it was the narrative that will no doubt be what sticks with me for some time.\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Last of Us Remastered is just a perfect game made even more perfect.\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It features a superb plot, contains at least one piece of essential DLC and looks absolutely stunning, making it an essential purchase for newcomers and one to consider for fans of the original.\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 As for recommending the game to PS4 owners, it's pretty obviously worth checking out — most definitely for those who skipped out on the PS3 version for whatever reason.\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Last of Us remains one of the most important games of the decade. It's a pinnacle in storytelling, an emotional journey and a great game overall. The same goes for the PS4 version, even though it has nothing new to offer besides the upgrade in its resolution.\n63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Last of Us Remastered on PS4 is still the fantastic game it used to be on PS3, with all the DLC and enhanced graphics and animations. If you missed it last year, that's definitely a must-buy.\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you’ve played The Last of Us, owning one of the best games of the last ten years in all its 1080p glory is worth the price of admission.\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Last of Us: Remastered is a complete GOTY Edition. It includes all DLC for Multiplayer, the amazing Left Behind, extended making of, cinematics commentary track, and more. Graphically, Naughty Dog studio sets a new standard in remasters. A masterpiece and its best version.\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1080p and 60fps (with rare drops). Better textures and shadows. But in the end, the most exciting part of this masterpiece is still the plot, the emotions and the tears. And one year after its original release, everything is still there to surprise you.\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The best version of one of the last generation's best games. Those expecting it to look totally 'next-gen' may be disappointed, as even at its peak it resembles a last-generation game being played at Ultra settings on PC. Still, it's obvious a lot of work and care has gone into this, and it will please both newcomers and old fans alike.\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Like the best visual updates, Remastered plays like you remember it. If you played 2013's Game of the Year near release and have been dying to return to the dark tale, then this is a great opportunity. If you never played The Last of Us at all, this is absolutely the way to do it.

If you never played The Last of Us at all, this is absolutely the way to do it. But be careful - you'll never want to go back to the PS3 original again after reveling in all the improvements.\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Last of Us remains a must-play, genre-defining action survival game, and the Remastered version brings with it plentiful tweaks and additional content that make it well worth the asking price.\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It’s as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and it’s worth your undivided attention whether you’ve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time.\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             If you didn't play it on PS3, this is definitely one the best second chances of your life. A must have for adventurers and gamers in general.\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  No matter if on PS3 or on PS4, The Last of Us is an experience you have to live. Obviously, if you have the chance of doing it with an improved version, with better visuals, extras and so on, the choice seems clear.\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Last of Us Remastered is a better-looking, better performing version of an already incredible game. As such, those who haven't played the original version should buy immediately, and those that have probably should as well.\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The remastered edition of The Last of Us is simply perfect.\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Last of Us: Remastered is a GOTY Edition. But, if you are expecting 'next-gen' graphics, you may be disappointed. After all, you can play The Last of Us with 1080p and 60FPS. It's the most important part of Remastered Edition.\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         With its improved detail, better draw distance, and slick 60fps presentation, The Last of Us Remastered is a beautiful update to a beautiful game. It is, however, a re-release of a game that isn't very old to begin with, and that bears taking into account.\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      After 13 months The Last of Us is still impressive. This Remastered edition is the perfect deal for those who have never played Naughty Dog's game, but it doesn't offer anything more to PS3 fans.\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This edition is a must-have only for those who have never had the opportunity to play the game on PS3 and own a PS4. All others can rekindle their old console. Despite this, The Last of Us Remastered is an excellent version of a masterpiece.\n17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There's not really enough distance between the PS3 version of The Last of Us and this new Remaster to make it worth double-dipping, unless you're simply that fixated on counting lines of resolution. If you missed out the first time around, though, you really shouldn't let it slip past again.\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Still a stunning achievement in both storytelling and third person adventure, and although this is the definitive version the differences are still minor.\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Last of Us is a great action game that you should play if you haven't already. And if you have played it before, the improvements here aren't so dramatic as to make the game feel like a new experience, but it is definitely one worth revisiting. In the world of The Last of Us, as in our own world, love might destroy you, but it's also one of the only things worth fighting for.\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 As for recommending the game to PS4 owners, it's pretty obviously worth checking out — most definitely for those who skipped out on the PS3 version for whatever reason.\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Last of Us remains one of the most important games of the decade. It's a pinnacle in storytelling, an emotional journey and a great game overall. The same goes for the PS4 version, even though it has nothing new to offer besides the upgrade in its resolution.\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A must have for those who couldn't play it on PS3. Intense, violent and emotional, Joel and Ellie's tale is as stunning as a year ago. Visual improvements and extra content are the only incentives those who played the original will find, and the reason they will have to think it's worth buying PS4's version.\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Simply put, The Last of Us: Remastered is just better than the PS3 version.\n24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Last of Us Remastered is better than the original in every single way, although the improvement doesn’t really enhance the experience all that much. If you have completed it already you can skip this version, but if you’ve missed out the adventure before you’re in a for a big treat.\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     While it may not seem like much, 1080p resolution and 60 fps are very welcome improvements for a nearly perfect game. Naughty Dog managed to do a flawless technical adaptation for the PlayStation 4. We would have loved a bit more extra content, but we can't complain, as the game already is one of the best ever created for a Sony platform.\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The heart-rending story isn`t romanticizing nor does it drift into the pathos other, less subtle games so often lean towards. That's the line where good craftsmanship becomes art, and an excellent game.\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In the end I came to the same conclusion now that I did back then: I had fun with the game itself, but it was the narrative that will no doubt be what sticks with me for some time.\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Last of Us Remastered is just a perfect game made even more perfect.\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It features a superb plot, contains at least one piece of essential DLC and looks absolutely stunning, making it an essential purchase for newcomers and one to consider for fans of the original.\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          What should really sweeten the deal for PS4 owners is the Remastered version of The Last of Us also includes the follow-up downloadable content, such as Ellie’s prequel chapter titled Left Behind. Which easily adds another two or three hours to the length of gameplay and expands on the riveting character developments.\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This is one of the best console ports in recent history, as it manages to fully capture the spirit of the original while improving upon it in nearly every way.\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Except for the Left Behind DLC, none of the other additions actually add to the experience. The game is just as good as it always has been, but with improved graphics being the only real selling point, the package is not enough for a second buy.\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Naughty Dog gives PlayStation gamers a second, definitive chance to experience one of the greatest video game stories. The Last of Us Remastered's additional content, visual enhancements, and improved performance leave very little standing in the way of a perfect encore.\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Do you need to get The Last of Us Remastered? Yes, if you didn't get the opportunity to play this PS3 masterpiece. The game enjoys the power of the PS4 without any trouble in very high resolution. The 60fps argument hits its target too, just like the price tag. But if you've already been there, no need to open your wallet, as this Remastered version doesn't bring anything new enough to put 50 euros on it.\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It’s tough to recommend for PS3 players who have already played the game, as the $55 price is a bit steep for some enhanced visuals and a bit of added content. But PlayStation 4 owners who haven’t yet experienced The Last of Us absolutely owe it to themselves to pick up this modern classic, and take a journey with Joel and Ellie across the heartbreakingly beautiful ruins of our world.\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Last of Us: Remastered is an enhanced edition of the succesfull game, exclusively for PlayStation 4. The remastered graphics, especially the improved ambiance and lighting, are a great asset to this game and make it a must-have for every PlayStation 4 owner, especially if you haven't played it yet.\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Last of Us for the PS4 is a perfect game for all people who haven't had the opportunity to get acquainted with it before. It's probably the best game available for this piece of hardware - great story, engaging gameplay and impressive technology. But if you know The Last of Us, you have nothing new to look for, except shiny graphics. And that's not really THAT important, is it?\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             While I’d rather not see a sequel, you should know that this Remastered version basically puts a T-ball stand in Sony’s living room where they’ve now started selling bats. Depending on the level of broken the company's biggest Bravia display could become given that scenario, I'd say the brand is worth a lot of money at the moment.\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Despite some decent titles on Sony’s new machine, you can’t deny the quality of Naughty Dog’s masterpiece. Even the staunchest of advocates that want original experiences on their new console will struggle to find much wrong with The Last of Us.\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Already a masterpiece, an upgraded Last of Us was going to be a win, but with the also brilliant Left Behind included as well as the resurgence of the multiplayer and the bonus featurettes, the remastered version is the best thing out right now.\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Last of Us finds a very appropriate home on the PS4.\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   One of the games on the PlayStation is now one of the best games on the PlayStation 4.\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Saying The Last Of Us: Remastered is an absolute triumph seems redundant. I said it when the original released last year, after all. And yeah, it's basically the same game with a glossier coating and a few additions. But consider: What have we seen in the last 15 months or so that even comes close? Seriously?\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Of course, the onboard add-on packs and smattering of superfluous extras ensure that this is the definitive edition of an already outstanding affair – but, unsurprisingly, it’s the touching tale at the heart of the package that once again sets it apart from its peers.\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  If you have yet to play The Last of Us, and you own a PlayStation 4, I can fully whole heartily say go buy this game, because you’re in for a memorable time. For fans, this is one you might want to pick up if you want to play the game at its best.\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Last of Us Remastered Edition enhances an already perfect game on the PlayStation 3 to something even more powerful on the PS4.\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Last of Us is truly the game of a generation, and the Remastered edition brings the harrowing adventure to a whole new generation with expert style.\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Last of Us remains a masterpiece.

It’s a must-have for any PS4 owners who didn’t play the original, and well-worth replaying for those who did.\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                       While The Last of Us was one of the PS3’s most impressive, engrossing releases, The Last of Us: Remastered feels like the version of Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic story of survival that the developer always intended us to play. Its story and characters are just as strong as they were before, but they’re now reinforced by far more amazing visuals, consistent framerate, and a nice selection of new bonus features and DLC inclusions.\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Last Of Us Remastered absolutely deserves a place in your PlayStation 4 collection, despite whether you’ve played it before or not.

And it is a fabulous story, riffing on Cormac McCarthy and other bleak post-apocalyptic fiction but keeping its own identity through its characters.\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Not only is The Last of Us technically brilliant, it has little things that just drag you further into the world.

It is a technologically successful remaster for PlayStation 4 owners who do not want to buy the older console just to get one game.\n59                                                                                                                                             The Last of Us Remastered honors its own name. It runs more smoothly, is prettier and has more content. The technical improvements and the Photo Mode make sure that The Last of Us comes into its own even more, while Left Behind on PlayStation 3 already proved that downloadable content can be of value. The small imperfections are still here and it’s unfortunate that the PlayStation 4 isn’t pushed to the limit.

Therefore, if looking for an unforgettable action-adventure, with strong cinematic sensibilities, and a heavy emphasis in adult, character-driven storytelling, look no further than Naughty Dog’s classic, especially now that the remastered version has made the original even more stunning.\n         date score\n1  2014-07-28   100\n2  2014-07-28   100\n3  2014-07-28   100\n4  2014-07-28   100\n5  2014-07-28   100\n6  2014-07-28   100\n7  2014-07-28   100\n8  2014-07-28   100\n9  2014-07-28    95\n10 2014-07-28    95\n11 2014-07-28    95\n12 2014-07-28    95\n13 2014-07-28    94\n14 2014-07-28    90\n15 2014-07-28    90\n16 2014-07-28    90\n17 2014-07-28    90\n18 2014-07-28    90\n19 2014-07-28    80\n20 2014-07-29   100\n21 2014-07-29   100\n22 2014-07-29    95\n23 2014-07-29    90\n24 2014-07-29    80\n25 2014-07-30   100\n26 2014-07-30   100\n27 2014-07-30   100\n28 2014-07-30   100\n29 2014-07-30   100\n30 2014-07-30    98\n31 2014-07-30    90\n32 2014-07-30    70\n33 2014-07-31    95\n34 2014-07-31    95\n35 2014-07-31    90\n36 2014-07-31    90\n37 2014-07-31    90\n38 2014-08-01   100\n39 2014-08-01   100\n40 2014-08-01   100\n41 2014-08-01    94\n42 2014-08-01    84\n43 2014-08-02   100\n44 2014-08-03   100\n45 2014-08-04   100\n46 2014-08-04   100\n47 2014-08-04    95\n48 2014-08-04    93\n49 2014-08-04    90\n50 2014-08-06   100\n51 2014-08-06    95\n52 2014-08-08   100\n53 2014-08-13    85\n54 2014-08-15   100\n55 2014-08-15   100\n56 2014-08-17    80\n57 2014-08-18    90\n58 2014-08-18    80\n59 2014-08-20    95\n60 2014-08-20    95\n61 2014-08-21    94\n62 2014-08-22    95\n63 2014-08-24    92\n64 2014-08-26   100\n65 2014-09-05   100\n66 2014-09-05    90\n67 2014-09-19   100\n68 2014-10-13   100\n69 2014-10-22    80\n70 2020-07-28    90\n\n\nNow we know who were the first people to review the game.

If you missed it last year, that's definitely a must-buy.\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Even if you’ve played The Last of Us, owning one of the best games of the last ten years in all its 1080p glory is worth the price of admission.\n3                                                                                                                      The Last of Us: Remastered is a complete GOTY Edition. It includes all DLC for Multiplayer, the amazing Left Behind, extended making of, cinematics commentary track, and more. Graphically, Naughty Dog studio sets a new standard in remasters. A masterpiece and its best version.\n4                                                                                                                                              1080p and 60fps (with rare drops). Better textures and shadows. But in the end, the most exciting part of this masterpiece is still the plot, the emotions and the tears. And one year after its original release, everything is still there to surprise you.\n5                                                         The best version of one of the last generation's best games. Those expecting it to look totally 'next-gen' may be disappointed, as even at its peak it resembles a last-generation game being played at Ultra settings on PC. Still, it's obvious a lot of work and care has gone into this, and it will please both newcomers and old fans alike.\n6  Like the best visual updates, Remastered plays like you remember it. If you played 2013's Game of the Year near release and have been dying to return to the dark tale, then this is a great opportunity. If you never played The Last of Us at all, this is absolutely the way to do it. But be careful - you'll never want to go back to the PS3 original again after reveling in all the improvements.\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Last of Us remains a must-play, genre-defining action survival game, and the Remastered version brings with it plentiful tweaks and additional content that make it well worth the asking price.\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It’s as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and it’s worth your undivided attention whether you’ve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time.\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              If you didn't play it on PS3, this is definitely one the best second chances of your life. A must have for adventurers and gamers in general.\n10                                                                                                                                                                                   No matter if on PS3 or on PS4, The Last of Us is an experience you have to live. Obviously, if you have the chance of doing it with an improved version, with better visuals, extras and so on, the choice seems clear.\n11                                                                                                                                                                       The Last of Us Remastered is a better-looking, better performing version of an already incredible game. As such, those who haven't played the original version should buy immediately, and those that have probably should as well.\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The remastered edition of The Last of Us is simply perfect.\n13                                                                                                                                                                    The Last of Us: Remastered is a GOTY Edition. But, if you are expecting 'next-gen' graphics, you may be disappointed. After all, you can play The Last of Us with 1080p and 60FPS. It's the most important part of Remastered Edition.\n14                                                                                                                                          With its improved detail, better draw distance, and slick 60fps presentation, The Last of Us Remastered is a beautiful update to a beautiful game. It is, however, a re-release of a game that isn't very old to begin with, and that bears taking into account.\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                       After 13 months The Last of Us is still impressive. This Remastered edition is the perfect deal for those who have never played Naughty Dog's game, but it doesn't offer anything more to PS3 fans.\n16                                                                                                                                                         This edition is a must-have only for those who have never had the opportunity to play the game on PS3 and own a PS4. All others can rekindle their old console. Despite this, The Last of Us Remastered is an excellent version of a masterpiece.\n17                                                                                                      There's not really enough distance between the PS3 version of The Last of Us and this new Remaster to make it worth double-dipping, unless you're simply that fixated on counting lines of resolution. If you missed out the first time around, though, you really shouldn't let it slip past again.\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Still a stunning achievement in both storytelling and third person adventure, and although this is the definitive version the differences are still minor.\n19            The Last of Us is a great action game that you should play if you haven't already. And if you have played it before, the improvements here aren't so dramatic as to make the game feel like a new experience, but it is definitely one worth revisiting. In the world of The Last of Us, as in our own world, love might destroy you, but it's also one of the only things worth fighting for.\n         date score\n1  2014-07-28   100\n2  2014-07-28   100\n3  2014-07-28   100\n4  2014-07-28   100\n5  2014-07-28   100\n6  2014-07-28   100\n7  2014-07-28   100\n8  2014-07-28   100\n9  2014-07-28    95\n10 2014-07-28    95\n11 2014-07-28    95\n12 2014-07-28    95\n13 2014-07-28    94\n14 2014-07-28    90\n15 2014-07-28    90\n16 2014-07-28    90\n17 2014-07-28    90\n18 2014-07-28    90\n19 2014-07-28    80\n\n\nCool, now we know of the 71 original reviews, 19 of them came two weeks after the game came out. Let’s say the next thing you want to know, specifically from the reviews on July 28, is how many of them gave the movie a perfect score.\nThere are a couple ways to go about this, but let’s start with one that pulls from our original data set.\nFirst, we’ll want to use the group_by function to pull from the July 28 date.\n\nlast_of_us_reviews %>% \n  group_by(date == \"2014-07-28\")\n\n# A tibble: 70 × 5\n# Groups:   date == \"2014-07-28\" [2]\n   id                   review                date  score `date == \"2014-07-28\"`\n   <chr>                <chr>                 <chr> <int> <lgl>                 \n 1 \"Cubed3\"             A post-apocalyptic r… 2020…    90 FALSE                 \n 2 \"\"                   Visual improvements … 2014…    80 FALSE                 \n 3 \"\"                   One of the best titl… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 4 \"\"                   For the most part, t… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 5 \"Eurogamer Portugal\" The Last of Us is on… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 6 \"\"                   PlayStation 4 makes … 2014…    90 FALSE                 \n 7 \"\"                   A refreshed classic … 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 8 \"\"                   A touch less impactf… 2014…    92 FALSE                 \n 9 \"Softpedia\"          Naughty Dog worked h… 2014…    95 FALSE                 \n10 \"\"                   It's the best versio… 2014…    94 FALSE                 \n# ℹ 60 more rows\n\n\nFrom there, we’ll filter for how many get a score of 100.\n\nlast_of_us_reviews %>% \n  group_by(date == \"2014-07-28\") %>% \n  filter(score == \"100\")\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 5\n# Groups:   date == \"2014-07-28\" [2]\n   id                    review               date  score `date == \"2014-07-28\"`\n   <chr>                 <chr>                <chr> <int> <lgl>                 \n 1 \"\"                    One of the best tit… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 2 \"\"                    For the most part, … 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 3 \"Eurogamer Portugal\"  The Last of Us is o… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 4 \"\"                    A refreshed classic… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 5 \"Telegraph\"           That the action in … 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 6 \"CalmDownTom\"         Not only is The Las… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 7 \"The Digital Fix\"     The Last Of Us Rema… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 8 \"Gamereactor Denmark\" Even if the Remaste… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n 9 \"DarkZero\"            If you have yet to … 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n10 \"Impulsegamer\"        The Last of Us Rema… 2014…   100 FALSE                 \n# ℹ 20 more rows\n\n\nFinally, we’ll put it all together so that r can count how many of the July 28 reviews got a perfect score.\n\nlast_of_us_reviews %>% \n  group_by(date == \"2014-07-28\") %>% \n  filter(score == \"100\") %>% \n  summarise(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  `date == \"2014-07-28\"` count\n  <lgl>                  <int>\n1 FALSE                     22\n2 TRUE                       8\n\n\nIt looks like 8 of the reviews got a perfect score.\nOur other option involves creating a new data set to get the exact same information. Let’s start off by creating a new data set.\n\nJuly_28_reviews <- last_of_us_reviews %>% filter(date == \"2014-07-28\")\n\nNow that that’s done, let’s do the same thing from before, but just filter by how many got a score of 100.\n\nJuly_28_reviews %>% \n  filter(score == \"100\") %>% \n  summarise(count = n())\n\n  count\n1     8\n\n\nAnd we got 8 again.\nNow you know the basics of filtering and sorting!"

They became instantly popular with their break-out single “What Makes You Beautiful in 2012. In the years between their formation in 2010 and member Zayn Malik leaving the band in 2015, the band would have 7 chart-topping songs. After their break-up, one would suspect that the members would fade into the pop culture oblivion, but the opposite has happened: the members are now topping the chart with their solo music. Zayn Malik, now ZAYN, has 5 singles and 2 features of his own that have made the charts. Members Niall Horan and Harry Styles, who both made their solo debuts in 2017, are beginning to follow in Zayn’s steps in topping the Top 10’s; Niall Horan currently has 2 songs, This Town and Slow Hands, on the chart, while Harry Styles has 1 with Sign of the Times."

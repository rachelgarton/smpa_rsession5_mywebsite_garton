Hi, I'm Rachel and I'm a fourth year student at George Washington University in Washington, DC. I am currently a financial assistant at the Student Org Finance Desk, but I have also completed a marketing internship at the Wilson Center in Wilmington, NC. I love reading, pop culture, and drawing. I plan to pursue an education in publishing post graduation.
